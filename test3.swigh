#header:
	#h1:
	Test
#body:
	#div {mainDiv} style[border-style<solid>]:
	This is a test of the HTML parser. 
	 It only works for HTML and CSS.
		#div:
			#login:
		#b style[color<purple>]:
		This is outside of the div that wraps the login,
		#i:
		 because it is it will be placed after the login component.
		#u:
		I should add inline elements aswel. 
		#span style [border-style<solid>background-color<lime>]:
		That would make it so you dont need to write all of this on seperate lines.
	
This is outside of the main div.  It is in the body tag scope outside of the 
	#span style [padding<1px> border-style<1px solid> background-color<red>]:
		{mainDiv}
